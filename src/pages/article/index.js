                                                    why chronic stress harms your skin. For instance, when you are more stressed
                                                    and tense, your body in turn releases stress hormones that increase your skin’s
                                                    oil production. This increase in oil production then increases your chances of experiencing breakouts.

                                                    Eczema, hives, and rosacea are just some skin problems that can result from
                                                    negative emotions and stress.

                                                happiness reduces stress levels, which, as discussed earlier, releases stress

                                                This entails removing all your makeup before bedtime, cleansing your face with a

                                                Studies have shown that genuine smiles release feel-good hormones in the body,
                                                contributing to healthy and radiant skin. You don't have to wait for a random
                                                reason to smile; you can bring a smile to your face by thinking about something
                                                or someone that brings you joy. It could be your toddler, a fond memory, a beloved pet,
                                                or a sweet surprise from a loved one. The act of recalling something that made
                                                you smile triggers the release of those feel-good hormones, making you feel

                                                        lifestyles. Consequently, it falls upon us to manage it effectively. This involves
                                                        actions like silencing our phones, ensuring adequate sleep and exercise, maintaining
                                                        a healthy diet, and incorporating stress management practices into our routine.
                                                        These practices can range from morning affirmations, journaling, meditation, yoga,
                                                        to inspirational reading—anything that helps slow your breathing, reduce heart rate,
                                                        and restore inner calm. Additionally, don't underestimate the rejuvenating power
                                                        of physical self-care, such as massage, facials, or indulging in a soothing, candlelit bubble bath.
